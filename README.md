Simple Floating Point Unit in MBF40bits (9-digits Basic) for a Z80 processor in Verilog (in progress)  
Only performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in floating point.   
It also includes a small C program to convert from floating point to MBF and vice versa to help with debugging.
